# RISC-V-Based-5-Stage-Pipelined-Processor

I Designed and Implemented a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor with hazard detection and forwarding to enable efficient execution of instructions with minimal stalls.

ðŸ“Œ Pipeline Stages -
The classic 5 stages:

Stage	Name -	Description
1	IF (Instruction Fetch)	Fetch instruction from memory using PC.
2	ID (Instruction Decode)	Decode instruction, read registers, generate control.
3	EX (Execute)	Perform ALU operations, branch target calc, forwarding.
4	MEM (Memory Access)	Access data memory for load/store.
5	WB (Write Back)	Write results back to the register file.

ðŸ“Œ Pipeline Registers -
We use pipeline registers to separate stages:

A) IF/ID
B) ID/EX
C) EX/MEM
D) MEM/WB

ðŸ“Œ Hazard Detection -
Identifies load-use hazards.

Inserts stalls as needed.

ðŸ“Œ Forwarding -
Forwards data from EX/MEM or MEM/WB to EX stage.

Eliminates unnecessary stalls.
